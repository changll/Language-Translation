Project description: 
    Use Mypy to implement an Abstract Syntax Tree(AST) to represent and interpret
    the python code.
    We handled integer and float values and various expression such as x+y,
    x-y, x*y, x/y, x//y, x%y, x**y, -x, --x, ---x, +x, (x).
    In addition, we implemented several forms of assignment: x+=y, x-=y, 
    x*=y, x/=y, x**=y, x//=y, x%=y.

The easiest part of this project: 
    To calculate the PLUS MINUS MULT DIVISION with the class Node and Literal
    that professor supplied.

Problems that I had in completing this project: 
    (1)the expressions -1/2-1/2 and -1/2+(-1/2) cost me much time and the ----x.
    then I compared the int and float division to decide the floor. And create a Literal
    0 to minus the node x.
    (2) the segment fault and termination with unexpected type  happened many times 
    and it always caused by the type definition in the parse.y.
