Project description: 
    Use Mypy to translate Python functions including scope resolution and 
    return value propagation.
    In addition, we need to translate if/else statements and also translate 
    the relational operators: < , > , <= , >= , == , !=.

The easiest part of this project: 
    The easiest part of this project is to translate the six relational operators.
    We have experience to do this based on arithmetic operators in the previous project.

Problems that I had in completing this project: 
    (1) Segment Fault shows several times, I didn't notice that there may be null pointer 
    evaluating the value;  after judge  the pointer, there are no segment fault.
    (2) About the return node and the scope resolution, I just jump out the current scope
    at first, and then I don't consider the if/else scope and when I met return, I jump out the
    function according to the symbol table.
    (3) For the None. I created a none literal class, when there is only return, and no node
    followed, I insert the symbol with the return and a Noneliteral pointer.
